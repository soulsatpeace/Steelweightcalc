About this app:

Steel Weight & Total Cost Calculator app is a simple calculator designed to calculate quantity of steel in kg, ton and its' cost. 
This app is completely free, does not have in-app purchases and does not have any advertisement at all. Your 5 star app rating is the only reward we expect.
To keep the app simple and free, it includes limited functionality. Further functionality will be added based on user feedback.

 
User needs to enter:
d = diameter of the steel reinforcement bar also known as ReBar, default value in case of no user input = 10mm
L = Length of ReBar, default value in case of no user input = 15meter
Q = Quantity of ReBar pieces, default value in case of no user input = 1 piece
Steel cost = cost of one kg steel in currency units, default value in case of no user input = 65bucks/Kg. If this value is in USD, the answer user will get will be in USD only.


The app calculates:
Total steel weight in Kg:  = Volume x Steel density = (π/4) x d2 X L x ρ, where ρ = Density of steel = 7860Kg/m3. User cannot change this density value.
Total steel weight in Ton: Total steel weight in Kg ÷ 1000
Total steel cost: Total steel weight in Kg  x  Steel cost

Grand total weight: It is the grand total weight of all the weights a user has calculated. For example, if user does 4 calculations for different set of ReBars, the grand total will show sum of all 4 separate weights. 
Grand total cost: Similar to grand total weight, this will show sum of all calculated costs.
Grand total weight and cost can be reset by using Reset button.
